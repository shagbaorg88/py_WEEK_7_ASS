# ðŸŒ¸ Flower Data Adventure

## What is this?

This is a fun project about flowers! We looked at information about 150 different flowers called irises. There are three types of these special flowers: setosa, versicolor, and virginica.

## What did we do?

1. **Looking at Flower Information** ðŸ“Š
   - We gathered all the flower measurements
   - We checked that we had all the information (no missing pieces!)
   - We learned about different parts of the flowers

2. **Flower Math** âž•
   - We found the average sizes of different flower parts
   - We discovered which flowers are biggest and smallest
   - We saw how the flowers are different from each other

3. **Pretty Pictures** ðŸŽ¨
   - We made colorful charts to show our discoveries
   - We drew lines, bars, and dots to help understand the flowers
   - We made pictures that show how flower parts are related

## Flower Facts We Learned

- Setosa flowers are the smallest
- Virginica flowers are the biggest
- Versicolor flowers are medium-sized
- The length and width of flower parts are related

## How to See the Flower Pictures

To see all the pretty flower charts, just run the code! It will show you:
- A line that goes up and down
- Colorful bars of different heights
- A mountain-shaped graph
- Dots that make pretty patterns

This helps us understand how beautiful and different flowers can be! ðŸŒˆ
